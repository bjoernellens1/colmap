# ROCm/HIP integration log

## Task 3: Rebase COLMAP PR #4420 onto current `upstream/main` (2026-08-04)

**Source:** `ishengnan/rocm-support` (PR [#4420](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/pull/4420),
"Add ROCm/HIP support for patch_match_stereo (AMD GPU)").

**Result:** Clean rebase, no conflicts.

`git rebase upstream/main` on a branch created from `ishengnan/rocm-support` completed
successfully with zero conflict hunks across all 8 commits. GitHub's `mergeable: true`
flag (checked prior to starting) held true at rebase time — `upstream/main` had not
drifted in a way that touched the same lines as the PR.

- Base (merge-base with `upstream/main`): `ecdeba302c511b552f6fcb38a03332212cbcc037`
- Rebased tip: `9c1cd066` ("Address remaining HIP review feedback")
- Commit count: 8 (matches PR #4420's original commit count)

Rebased commit range (`upstream/main..hip-integration` after fold-in):

```

**Steps taken:**
1. `git fetch ishengnan rocm-support` / `git fetch upstream main`.
2. `git checkout -b colmap-patchmatch-rebase ishengnan/rocm-support`.
3. `git rebase upstream/main` — completed cleanly (8/8 commits applied, no conflict markers).
4. `git checkout hip-integration && git reset --hard colmap-patchmatch-rebase`.
5. `git branch -D colmap-patchmatch-rebase`.
6. `git push --force-with-lease origin hip-integration` — accepted
   (`f6cfb683...9c1cd066 hip-integration -> hip-integration (forced update)`).

**Conflicts encountered:** None. No manual conflict resolution was required for this track.

**Follow-on:** Task 4 will build using
`-DCUDA_ENABLED=OFF -DHIP_ENABLED=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1151` per the produced
`HIP_ENABLED` CMake option.
